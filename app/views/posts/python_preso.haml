%h2 Use Case Discussion

Ted the Trader lives in California; he uses his lunch hour to rebalance his position in SPY once a day.

%br/
%br/

On a Tuesday at 12:50 PM he sees a new prediction appear at http://www.AIspy.info and that prediction is bullish.

%br/
%br/

Ted looks at his current position of SPY inside his brokerage account and sees that it is bearish.

%br/
%br/

At 12:55 PM Ted rebalances his position of SPY so that it is bullish and Ted is done trading for that Tuesday.

%h2 Development Environment Setup

AIspy is developed on Ubuntu 14.

%br/
%br/

I like this release:

%br/
%br/

%a(href='http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/ubuntu-14.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso' target='x')

I prefer to run Ubuntu on a newish-laptop.  I can usually replace
windows-10 with Ubuntu in about 9 minutes.  After the initial Ubuntu
bootup, I need about 30 minutes install all the latest Ubuntu updates.

%br/
%br/

A suitable newish-laptop should cost less than $500 and have one of these CPUs:
i3, i5, i7, or A10

%br/
%br/

If Ubuntu fails to install on the newish-laptop, I return the laptop to the store for a refund.

%br/
%br/

Stores I like ordered by preference: Costco, Walmart, OfficeDepot, BestBuy 

%br/
%br/

Stores I dislike: Frys, dell.com, hp.com, lenovo.com, google-express

%br/
%br/

If I want to leave windows-10 on the laptop, I can use a USB drive to power Linux on the laptop while windows-10 sleeps.

%br/
%br/

Another way to run Ubuntu is inside of a VirtualBox on my Mac.

%br/
%br/

It is possible to run Ubuntu inside of a VirtualBox inside of windows-10 but that setup often displays bad behavior.

%br/
%br/

It is possible to build a Mac-only development environment but that environment becomes more cumbersome as the ML-app grows in complexity.

%br/
%br/

It is possible to build a complex ML-app which runs on both Mac and Ubuntu but my attitude is 'why bother?'

%br/
%br/

Instead I just pick the OS which will support the production-app, in this case Ubuntu, and then use that OS to underlie my development environment.

%br/
%br/

During installation the Ubuntu wizard will ask my name.

%br/
%br/

For the AIspy-app the proper response is: 'ann'

%br/
%br/

Ubuntu will then create a privileged account named: 'ann'

%br/
%br/

After I install Ubuntu, I run shell commands to enhance it:
%pre
  =render 'python_preso10'

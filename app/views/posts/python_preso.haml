%h2 Use Case Discussion
%ul
  %li Ted the Trader lives in California; he uses his lunch hour to rebalance his position in SPY once a day.
  %li On a Tuesday at 12:50 PM he sees a new prediction appear at http://www.pyspy.info and that prediction is bullish.
  %li Ted looks at his current position of SPY inside his brokerage account and sees that it is bearish.
  %li At 12:55 PM Ted rebalances his position of SPY so that it is bullish.
  %li Ted is done trading for that Tuesday.

%h2 Development Environment Setup

I use Ubuntu 14 to develop and run pyspy.

%br/
%br/

I like this release:

%br/
%br/

%a(href='http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/ubuntu-14.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso' target='x')
  http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/ubuntu-14.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso

%br/
%br/

I prefer to run Ubuntu on a newish-laptop.  I can usually replace
windows-10 with Ubuntu in about 9 minutes.  After the initial Ubuntu
bootup, I need about 30 minutes to install all the latest Ubuntu updates.

%br/
%br/

A suitable newish-laptop should cost less than $500.
Ubuntu friendly CPUs are i3, i5, i7, or A10; avoid Pentium.

%br/
%br/

If Ubuntu fails to install on the newish-laptop, I return the laptop to the store for a refund.

%br/
%br/

Stores which behave well: Costco, Walmart, OfficeDepot, and BestBuy .

%br/
%br/

If I want to leave windows-10 on the laptop, I can use a USB drive to power Linux on the laptop while windows-10 sleeps.

%br/
%br/

Another way to run Ubuntu is inside of a VirtualBox on my Mac.

%br/
%br/

It is possible to run Ubuntu inside of a VirtualBox inside of windows-10 but that setup often displays bad behavior.

%br/
%br/

It is possible to build a Mac-only development environment but that environment becomes more cumbersome as the ML-app grows in complexity.

%br/
%br/

It is possible to build a complex ML-app which runs on both Mac and Ubuntu but my attitude is 'why bother?'

%br/
%br/

Instead I just pick the OS which will support the production-app, in this case Ubuntu, and then use that OS to host my development environment.

%br/
%br/

During installation the Ubuntu wizard will ask my name and where I live.

%br/
%br/

For the pyspy-app the proper name is: 'ann'

%br/
%br/

Ubuntu will then create a privileged account named: 'ann'

%br/
%br/

Also I should tell the wizard that I live in California so that predictions generated at 12:50pm will be 10 minutes before market close at 13:00 pm.

%br/
%br/

After I install Ubuntu, I run shell commands to enhance it:
%pre
  =render 'python_preso10'

With that behind me I should install ta-lib:
%pre
  =render 'python_preso11'

After I install ta-lib, I should install python:
%pre
  =render 'python_preso12'

Then, I should pip install TA-lib:
%pre
  %code.bash
    pip install TA-Lib
    python -c 'import numpy, talib'

%h2 Data Acquistion (Automated)
For pyspy, automated data acquistion is simple.
%ul
  %li Create a folder for data
  %li Clone a repo with a script to copy data into the folder
  %li Create a cron entry to run the script at 12:50 M-F.
  %li I list syntax below to do this:

%pre
  =render 'python_preso13'

The crontab in the above example assumes that you are in the California timezone.

%br/
%br/

If you are in a different timezone, study the comments in ~/pyspy/crontab.txt to see what you should change.

%h2 Data Acquistion (Manual at Night)

To manually acquire data, run this shell script:

%pre
  %code.bash ~/pyspy/bin/night.bash

I captured some screen output when I did that:

%pre
  =render 'python_preso14'

%h2 Data Acquistion (Manual at Near Calif-Noon)

When the market is near close (California lunch hour) sometimes I will manually acquire data:

%pre
  %code.bash ~/pyspy/bin/noon50.bash

I captured some screen output when I did that:

%pre
  =render 'python_preso15'

The script
%a(href='https://github.com/danbikle/pyspy/blob/master/bin/noon50.bash' target='g')
  noon50.bash
is an enhanced version of
%a(href='https://github.com/danbikle/pyspy/blob/master/bin/night.bash' target='g')
  night.bash

%br/
%br/

The script
%a(href='https://github.com/danbikle/pyspy/blob/master/bin/noon50.bash' target='g')
  noon50.bash
gets the most recent price by scraping a web-page with python.

%h2 Feature Creation with Python

When I talk with stock-traders about how they decide to open or close a position,
often they will describe an example of a price chart:

%br/
%br/

%img(src='/images/python_preso16.png')

%br/
%br/

For example they might overlay a simple-moving-average on top of a price-time-series and then make decisions based on rules which they believe are true.

%br/
%br/

An example of a rule might be this statement:
When price is below a 5-day-moving average, I should be bullish.

%br/
%br/

A Python programmer might look at that rule and ask,
"How to use Python to build a 5-day-moving average and then compare it to the price?"

%br/
%br/

The answer is, it is relatively easy to do this calculation in Python.

%br/
%br/

As a product manager I would describe how I want to interact with this calculation.

%br/
%br/

Currently, I would be happy if the calculation was placed within a simple 2D Python-List:

%pre
  %code.python
    [
    ["2015-12-01",2102.63,price_over5d_sma]
    ,["2015-12-02",2079.51,price_over5d_sma]
    ,["2015-12-03",2049.62,price_over5d_sma]
    ,["2015-12-04",2091.69,price_over5d_sma]
    ]

As a programmer I would look at the above example and then write this python code:

%pre
  =render 'python_preso16'

%br/
%br/

%h2 Feature Creation with NumPy

As a Product Manager I would want more features than just current_price / mvg_avg.

%br/
%br/

The code below demonstrates how to create more features from prices:

%pre
  =render 'python_preso17'

%br/
%br/

%h2 Feature Creation with TA-lib

The code below demonstrates how to create more features from Bollinger Bands calculated using TA-lib:

%pre
  =render 'python_preso18'

%br/
%br/

%h2 Feature Visualization with Pandas

Pandas offers a syntax for applying predicates to tabular data.

%br/
%br/

I can use this syntax to visualize dependency between features and future deltas:

%pre
  =render 'python_preso19'

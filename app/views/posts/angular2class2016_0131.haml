This page corresponds to a Meetup and a git-repo:

%ul
  %li
    %a(href='http://www.meetup.com/Dans-Linux-JavaScript-Class/events/228359487' target='x')

      https://github.com/danbikle/ang2tut201602

The purpose of the Meetup is to help you start learning Angular2.

%br/
%br/

The git-repo is a teaching aid for the Meetup but should be good enough to point you down the path of learning Angular2.

We start the class by assuming you have Ubuntu installed on your laptop.

%br/
%br/

If you want to try doing this class with MacOS/X instead of Ubuntu, that should be do-able.

%br/
%br/

I start by installing Ubuntu 14.04 on my laptop.
%br/
%br/


The most recent version of Ubuntu which I like is at this URL:
%br/
%br/


%a(href='http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04.3/ubuntu-14.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso' target='x')
  http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04.3/ubuntu-14.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso
%br/
%br/


The three general paths to install Ubuntu on a laptop are listed below:
%ul
  %li Remove Windows and install Ubuntu
  %li Ignore Windows and install Ubuntu on USB drive
  %li Install VirtualBox on Mac or Windows, Install Ubuntu inside VirtualBox

My favorite path is path2: Ignore Windows and install Ubuntu on USB drive.
%br/
%br/

Path2 works well with a new laptop should I want to maintain the warranty.
%br/
%br/

If you are new to the world of Ubuntu laptops I suggest you buy a cheap windows laptop from Walmart and run some experiments.

When I install Ubuntu, it will ask who I am.
%br/
%br/

I tell Ubuntu that my name is ann.
%br/
%br/

Then, Ubuntu will create an account named ann which has useful privileges.
%br/
%br/

If you use a different initial account, you should create an account named ann after you boot the laptop.
%br/
%br/

The shell commands to create the ann account are listed below:
%pre
  %code.bash
    sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash ann
    sudo passwd ann

The first command creates ann.
%br/
The second command gives her a password.
%br/
%br/

After I create the ann account, I enhance and update Ubuntu.
%br/
%br/

The shell commands to do this are listed below:
%pre
  =render 'angular2class2016_0131a'

After that I login as ann and I download Node.js.
%pre
  %code.bash
    cd ~
    wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v5.5.0/node-v5.5.0-linux-x64.tar.gz


Then I install it:
%pre
  %code.bash
    cd ~
    rm -rf  node
    tar zxf node-v5.5.0-linux-x64.tar.gz
    mv      node-v5.5.0-linux-x64 node

So, I did that on my laptop.

Then I did this:
%pre
  %code.bash
    cd ~ann
    git clone https://github.com/danbikle/ang2tut201602
    cd  ang2tut201602
    npm install
    npm start

The console indicated that lite-server was serving at two URLs:
%br/
%br/

http://localhost:3000
%br/
%br/

http://localhost:3001
%br/
%br/

The first URL corresponded to my Angular2 app.
%br/
%br/

The second URL corresponded to an admin-UI for lite-server.
%br/
%br/

I saw this:
%pre
  =render 'angular2class2016_0131b'

Also it brought up a browser and displayed the h1-element I had typed into app/app.component.ts.
%br/
%br/

And I noticed that it created some new files in my git repo:
%pre
  %code.bash
    app/app.component.js
    app/app.component.js.map
    app/boot.js
    app/boot.js.map

The way I got started with Angular2 development is to memorize a set of words which I see in the tutorial.
%br/
%br/

This is a boring way to learn development but I need to know how to describe the internals of my Angular2 apps when I work with other people.
%br/
%br/

This is similar to learning a foreign language like French.
%br/
%br/

I need to start by memorizing some words.
%br/
%br/

For Angualar2, the words I need to memorize are listed below in alphabetical order:

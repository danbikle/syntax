Description: small, friendly text editor inspired by Pico
 GNU nano is an easy-to-use text editor originally designed as a replacement for
 Pico, the ncurses-based editor from the non-free mailer package Pine (itself
 now available under the Apache License as Alpine). 
 
 However, nano also implements many features missing in pico, including: 
 * feature toggles; 
 * interactive search and replace (with regular expression support); 
 * go to line (and column) command; 
 * auto-indentation and color syntax-highlighting; 
 * filename tab-completion and support for multiple buffers; 
 * full internationalization support.

Q: How to Copy a Linux instance?

%br/

Usually the answer to this question is, 'That depends', but one certainty is that I need to 
shut it down before I copy it (login as root and type: shutdown -h now).

A1: If the instance is the host-OS on my laptop, I don't know how to copy it.
Obviously I know how to copy files in it to something like a USB-stick or blank DVD.

This means that I keep my laptop-Linux as simple as possible.

A2: If the instance is inside VirtualBox, 
I can easily copy it to a large file on the laptop.
Then I can copy that large file to DVD(s), USB-stick, or other laptop.

%br/
%br/
I can copy using the GUI or I can issue a command like this on the host-os:

%pre
  %code.bash /usr/bin/vboxmanage export my_ubuntu_virtualbox -o ~/Documents/my_ubuntu_virtualbox.ova


A3: If the instance is inside a cloud provider they always offer a way to backup your Linux-instances.

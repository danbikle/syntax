I use this post to get students started with using Capybara-Selenium to run
RSpec feature tests on Rails.

Some students ask an obvious question, "Why should I use Capybara-Selenium to run
RSpec feature tests on Rails?"

I usually answer with these responses:
%ul
  %li For small Rails-prototype applications, Capybara-Selenium is optimal.
  %li I can use Capybara-Selenium to test the JavaScript syntax in my Rails app.
  %li Watching a robotic browser walk through my app gives me a sense of comfort.
  %li Capybara-Selenium tests all or most layers in my Rails app.
  %li Capybara-Selenium tests are a good place to start writing tests in my app.

What are some drawbacks to Capybara-Selenium testing?

%ul
  %li It is slow.
  %li It tests many layers at once, so it is not specific.
  %li It depends on a browser like Firefox.

The steps listed below are useful to me when I create a new Rails app which has Capybara-Selenium testing enabled:

%pre
  =render 'rails_rspec_capybara_selenium1'

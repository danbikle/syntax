# This script should work on a CSV file from Yahoo with a while-loop.

# I should cd to the right folder:

cd ~ann

export TKR=GSPC

# Assume that ${TKR}4.csv was just built and it has these columns
# Date, Close, date_lag, close_lag

# I should build a CSV which has these columns:
echo 'cdate, cp, lag_date, lag_price, delta, pctg' > ${TKR}5.csv

echo I am busy, please wait ...

# In Bash undeclared variables are strings.
# I should declare to Bash that I will use variables which hold float numbers:
declare -f current_price previous_price delta pctg

grep -v Date ${TKR}4.csv | while read line 
do
  current_price=`echo  $line|cut -d, -f2`
  previous_price=`echo $line|cut -d, -f4`
  delta=`echo $current_price - $previous_price | bc`
  pctg=`echo "scale=4; 100.0 * $delta / $previous_price" | bc`
  echo $line , $delta , $pctg >> ${TKR}5.csv
done

echo I am done, I created ${TKR}5.csv from ${TKR}4.csv
echo Here look:

head ${TKR}5.csv

exit

I start this demo by referring to this page:

http://docs.h2o.ai/Ruser/rtutorial.html

I tried walking through the gbm section.

First I made note of the h2o version:

> 
> 
> h2o.clusterInfo(localH2O)
R is connected to H2O cluster:
    H2O cluster uptime:         17 hours 51 minutes 
    H2O cluster version:        2.9.0.1689 
    H2O cluster name:           H2O_started_from_R 
    H2O cluster total nodes:    1 
    H2O cluster total memory:   1.54 GB 
    H2O cluster total cores:    4 
    H2O cluster allowed cores:  2 
    H2O cluster healthy:        TRUE 
> 
> 

The above version was posted to the web on or about 2015-02-06.

Next I tried their system.file() call.

They dont explain what it does but I figured it out by studying the result:

> 
> 
> ausPath = system.file("extdata", "australia.csv", package="h2o")
> 
> 


> 
> ausPath
[1] "/home/dan/rdir/lib/R/library/h2o/extdata/australia.csv"
> 
> 

It is creating a simple string from the location of a CSV file called:

australia.csv

I'm not sure where the file came from but obviously the author of the 
R tutorial was confident that the CSV file is now on my laptop.

He/She can do this because the file is part of my R installation.

Next I feed that to h2o.importFile() which is a call I often see in h2o-R scripts:

> 
> australia.hex = h2o.importFile(localH2O, path = ausPath)

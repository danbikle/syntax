.q1 Question:
.q2 How do I highlight Python syntax inside an HTML code-element served by a Rails application?
.tags
  %span.tagtag Tags:
  %a(href='/tags/rails') rails
  %a(href='/tags/javascript') javascript
  %a(href='/tags/python') python
  %a(href='/tags/highlight') highlight
  %a(href='/tags/pre_code') pre_code

Recently I encountered a use-case where I wanted to highlight Python syntax inside a blog entry.

The website was being served by Rails.

I searched on google and found a JavaScript library named highlight.js:

%a(href='https://highlightjs.org' target='x')
  https://highlightjs.org

I read the directions there and then added some syntax to my Rails layout file:

%pre
  =render 'rails_highlight_pre_code_syntax1'


I then placed the Python syntax in a pre-code element and looked at it
with my browser.

The Python syntax looks like this:

%pre
  %code.python
    print('Python says hello world')

I am pleased with highlight.js and think it is a good general purpose syntax highlighting library.

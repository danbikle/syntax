To do Machine Learning on Linux, the first Service I should learn about is openssh.

%br/
%br/

Once openssh is installed and running, then I will be able to 'ssh-in' to the machine.

%br/
%br/

Openssh is running software which waits for work to do.

%br/
%br/

This behavior defines what a service is.

%br/
%br/

Other examples of services are the Apache webserver and the PostgreSQL database server.

%br/
%br/

On Ubuntu, I setup these services using the aptitude utility.

%br/
%br/

Here is a demo of me installing and then starting the openssh server:

%pre
  =render 'linux101_cclud_sshd1'

%br/

For some services the final installation step is to reboot the machine.

%br/
%br/

A good way to reboot a machine is to issue this shell command as root:

%pre
  %code.bash shutdown -r now

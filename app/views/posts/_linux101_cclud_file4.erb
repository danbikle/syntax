Oh, by the way,
I can update the timestamp of a file using the touch command:

dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ touch updateme.txt 
dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ ls -l updateme.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 dan dan 10 Feb 11 09:31 updateme.txt
dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ 

Sorry for the interruption.

So far I showed how to use a caret to create and copy a file.
I can also use caret to update a file.

If I use single-caret I overwrite the file which is sometimes a bad thing.
Be careful with single-caret.

dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ echo Dan was here > dan.txt
dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ cat dan.txt
Dan was here
dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ echo Evil Dan was here > dan.txt
dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ cat dan.txt
Evil Dan was here
dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ 

If I use a double-caret I add text to the end of the file
instead of 'clobbering' the file.

dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ echo Dan was here >> dan.txt
dan@feb /tmp $ echo Dan was here >> dan.txt
dan@feb /tmp $ echo Dan was here >> dan.txt
dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ cat dan.txt
Evil Dan was here
Dan was here
Dan was here
Dan was here
dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ echo Evil Bob was here > dan.txt
dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ cat dan.txt
Evil Bob was here
dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $

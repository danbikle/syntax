# This script should take a large Forex CSV file as input.
# Then it should divide up the file into 6 pieces.
# Each piece contains data for 1 pair aud_usd for example.
# Each of the 6 pieces should be divided into 12 pieces.
# Each piece contains data for a 5 minute interval.
# I have 12 pieces because 1 hour contains 12 intervals.
# When done, this script should give me 6x12 == 72 files.

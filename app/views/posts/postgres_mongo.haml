On Ubuntu it is easy to install both PostgreSQL and MongoDB on the same host.

Then it is easy to compare them.

%h2 PostgreSQL AKA Postgres

When I installed Postgres on my Linux laptop I followed some steps.

I issued a shell command:

apt-get install postgresql postgresql-server-dev-all libpq-dev

After that finished, I rebooted the laptop.

The next series of steps depend on the name of my linux account.

On my laptop I login to linux as dan.

Postgres works well on my laptop if I create an account inside of Postgres named dan.

Also Postgres wants me to create a database inside of Postgres named dan.

I created an account named dan inside using some shell commands:

sudo su - postgres

The above command put me into the Linux-Postgres account.

Then I used a command name psql to connect to the Postgres instance.

I saw this:
postgres@nia111:~$ 
postgres@nia111:~$ 
dan@nia111:~/x611 $ sudo su - postgres
[sudo] password for dan: 
postgres@nia111:~$ 
postgres@nia111:~$ 

postgres@nia111:~$ 
postgres@nia111:~$ psql
psql (9.3.11)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# 
postgres=# 


Next I created a dan account inside of Postgres:

create role dan with superuser login;

Then, I created a database named dan.

create database dan;

Next, I entered '\q' which allowed me to exit psql.

Then, I entered the shell command: exit which allowed me to leave the
postgres linux account and return to my dan linux account.

%h2 Copy, Create, List, Update, Delete (CCLUD)

When I encounter a new technology I learn it by understanding both nouns and verbs which frequently appear inside the technology.

Five verbs which I usually see in software systems are listed below:

Copy, Create, List, Update, Delete (CCLUD)

The above five verbs are prominent within Postgres.

Above I displayed two examples of the Create-verb:
%ul
  %li I created the role, dan.
  %li I created the database, dan.

Also I updated the role, dan by giving it two privileges: superuser and login.

%h2 Postgres Nouns

For Postgres, the nouns which I want to operate on with the 5 verbs are listed below:
%ul
  %li Postgres-Instance
  %li Postgres-Linux-Account
  %li Postgres-Role
  %li Postgres-Database
  %li Postgres-Table
  %li Postgres-Row
  %li Postgres-Index
  %li Postgres-View

The most common verb-noun combinations are listed below:

Create Table
List Table
Delete Table

Copy, Create, List, Update, Delete: Row

Examples of the 8 above combinations are listed below:

How to CCLUD files.

To create a single file I can use a carrot.

Actucally it is a caret not a carrot.

A caret is easy to remember because it starts with a c just like create.

echo To create a file a caret is better than a stick. 
echo To create a file a caret is better than a stick. > /tmp/carrot.txt

Another way is to use a command called ed.

ed
i
I like caret better than ed.
.
w /tmp/ed.txt
q

Another way is to use a command called vi.

vi /tmp/vi.txt
i
I like vi better than ed.
esc-key
:w
:q

Another way is to use a command called emacs.

emacs /tmp/emacs.txt
follow the emacs menus if you have gui-emacs.
Otherwise, you are in character emacs which is difficult.

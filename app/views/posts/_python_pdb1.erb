# This script should demo how to use pdb.

# I should do this first:
import pdb

# Do something simple here:

avar = 1
bvar = 2
cvar = 3

# When Python sees next line,
# it should stop running the script 
# and then present a pdb command line UI to me:
pdb.set_trace()

# Once in pdb, I can type in the name of a variable to see its value:
# avar

dvar = 4

# done

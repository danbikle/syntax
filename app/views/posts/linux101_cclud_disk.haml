Disk space depends on a concept called 'File System'.

%br/
%br/

A file system is an upside down tree.
%br/
%br/

The tree contains directories.
%br/
%br/

A directory is the same as a folder in Windows-speak.

%br/
%br/

A directory contains files and other directories.

%br/
%br/

A directory might look like this:

%pre
  %code.bash /home/dan

A file might look like this:

%pre
  %code.bash /home/dan/hello.txt

At the very top of the file system is a single directory called:

%pre
  %code.bash /

This is different than Windows.

%br/
%br/

If I go to the very top of a Windows I will find a collection of folders with names like C: and D:.

%br/
%br/

This is a user friendly feature of Windows.
It is giving me information about the physical storage devices and how they relate to the Windows file system.

Now I return to the original question:
%br/
Q: In Linux101 how to CCLUD Disk space?

%br/
%br/
That question is too large for a Linux101 class.
%br/
%br/
I will scope it down to this question:
%br/
%br/
Q: In Linux101 on Ubuntu running in VirtualBox, how to CCLUD Disk space?

The 2015_1212 Code Challenge is a learning exercise for students attending Dan's Linux JavaScript Class at 3pm on 2015-12-06 at Hacker Dojo:

In class we will study a repository with the chrome-browser debugger:

%br/
%br/

%a(href='https://github.com/danbikle/deep500' target='x')
  https://github.com/danbikle/deep500

%br/

Already, the above repository should be deployed at meteor.com for you
so you can use a browser (currently Chrome only) to study the behavior of
the JavaScript:

%br/
%br/

%a(href='https://deep500.meteor.com' target='x')
  https://deep500.meteor.com

The steps I followed to run this repository on my Ubuntu host are listed below:

%ul
  %li
    This repo depends on Meteor so I installed it:
    %pre
      %code.bash
        cd ~
        curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
        echo 'export PATH=${HOME}/.meteor:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
        bash

  %li
    Next I ensured that my Ubuntu host had both curl and git:
    %pre
      %code.bash sudo apt-get install curl gitk

  %li
    Then I cloned the deep500 repo:
    %pre
      %code.bash
        cd ~
        git clone https://github.com/danbikle/deep500

  %li
    Then I started the Meteor server:
    %pre
      %code.bash
        cd ~/deep500
        git checkout -b mybranch
        \~/.meteor/meteor

  %li
    I started Chrome (not Firefox) and browsed this URL:
    %br/
    %a(href='http://localhost:3000' target='x')
      http://localhost:3000

  %li I saw a page which was mostly empty.
  %li I created an account via the Sign-in-link.
  %li Then I logged in and created a model.
  %li Next, I clicked the 'chart em' button to see what I call the "blue-green visualization".

That could be considered an adequate code challenge for a two hour Meetup.

After I create the ann account and then learn vi, how to install and use Emacs editor ?

%br/
%br/

First I login as ann with a command like this:

%pre
  %code.bash ssh -YA ann@localhost

Then I type these shell commands:

%pre
  %code.bash
    sudo apt-get install emacs
    emacs hello.txt

If your Linux is setup well, you should see Emacs come up as a GUI editor.

%br/
%br/

If Emacs cannot figure out how to come up as a GUI editor, it will come up as a character-based editor.

%br/
%br/

I urge students to use the GUI editor if it is available and I advise them to stay away from Emacs
if the GUI editor is unavailable.

%br/
%br/

For a character based editor, vi is a better choice than Emacs.

%br/
%br/

For a GUI editor, Emacs is best and it is easy to use.

%br/
%br/

When Emacs comes up I just start typing into it and my text goes into the file I want to edit.
In this case the file is hello.txt

%br/
%br/

When I am done, I just use my mouse on the top-menu to save and exit.

%br/
%br/

It is much easier than vi. I do not need to memorize commands or know what mode I am in.

%br/
%br/

One thing I notice about people who use Emacs is they leave it open.

%br/
%br/

Usually with other editors, I open, edit, save, and then close.

%br/
%br/

With Emacs I open, edit, save, and leave it open.

%br/
%br/

Emacs offers two features in addition to file-edit which encourage me to leave it open.

%br/
%br/

First, I can run a shell in Emacs and I can name the shell.
If I have 17 shells open, I want them to be named and I want them displayed in a list of shells.
Emacs does this feature very well.

%br/
%br/

Second, I use Emacs to operate on folders.
The folder-UI in Emacs is superior to any folder-UI I have seen.

%br/
%br/

The way I operate Emacs is to stay in a tight triangle where I
bounce between the three points: file-editor, folder-editor, and shell.

%br/
%br/

Shell programming without emacs is a chore.
It feels like I am juggling three types of windows.
When I move between window types it feels slow and mentally taxing.

%br/
%br/

Emacs offers another feature which speeds development.  I run Emacs in GUI mode on my laptop and
use it to edit files on Linux running elsewhere.

%br/
%br/

This feature frees me from the chore of using vi on remote Linux instances.

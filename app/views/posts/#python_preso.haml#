%h2 Use Case Discussion
%ul
  %li Ted the Trader lives in California; he uses his lunch hour to rebalance his position in SPY once a day.
  %li On a Tuesday at 12:50 PM he sees a new prediction appear at http://www.AIspy.info and that prediction is bullish.
  %li Ted looks at his current position of SPY inside his brokerage account and sees that it is bearish.
  %li At 12:55 PM Ted rebalances his position of SPY so that it is bullish.
  %li Ted is done trading for that Tuesday.

%h2 Development Environment Setup

AIspy is developed on Ubuntu 14.

%br/
%br/

I like this release:

I prefer to run Ubuntu on a newish-laptop.  I can usually replace
windows-10 with Ubuntu in about 9 minutes.  After the initial Ubuntu
bootup, I need about 30 minutes to install all the latest Ubuntu updates.

%br/
%br/

A suitable newish-laptop should cost less than $500.
Ubuntu friendly CPUs are i3, i5, i7, or A10; avoid Pentium.

%br/
%br/

If Ubuntu fails to install on the newish-laptop, I return the laptop to the store for a refund.

%br/
%br/

Stores which behave well: Costco, Walmart, OfficeDepot, and BestBuy .

%br/
%br/

If I want to leave windows-10 on the laptop, I can use a USB drive to power Linux on the laptop while windows-10 sleeps.

%br/
%br/

Another way to run Ubuntu is inside of a VirtualBox on my Mac.

%br/
%br/

It is possible to run Ubuntu inside of a VirtualBox inside of windows-10 but that setup often displays bad behavior.

%br/
%br/

It is possible to build a Mac-only development environment but that environment becomes more cumbersome as the ML-app grows in complexity.

%br/
%br/

It is possible to build a complex ML-app which runs on both Mac and Ubuntu but my attitude is 'why bother?'

%br/
%br/

Instead I just pick the OS which will support the production-app, in this case Ubuntu, and then use that OS to underlie my development environment.

%br/
%br/

During installation the Ubuntu wizard will ask my name and where I live.

%br/
%br/

For the AIspy-app the proper name is: 'ann'

%br/
%br/

Ubuntu will then create a privileged account named: 'ann'

%br/
%br/

Also I should tell the wizard that I live in California so that predictions generated at 12:50pm will be 10 minutes before market close at 13:00 pm.

After I install Ubuntu, I run shell commands to enhance it:
%pre
  =render 'python_preso10'

With that behind me I should install ta-lib:
%pre
  =render 'python_preso11'

After I install ta-lib, I should install python:
%pre
  =render 'python_preso12'

To create a file, a caret is better than a stick.
dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ 

The above commands list carrot.txt.
I know what it looks like now.

Now, I copy the carrot.txt file:

dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ cp carrot.txt caret.txt
dan@feb /tmp $ 

That was easy.
Are they the same?
dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ ls -l carrot.txt caret.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 dan dan 50 Feb 11 07:54 caret.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 dan dan 50 Feb 11 07:37 carrot.txt
dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ cat caret.txt 
To create a file, a caret is better than a stick.
dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ 

Yes, they are the same.
Here is another way to copy a file.
I use the cat command and a ... caret!

dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ cat caret.txt > caret2.txt
dan@feb /tmp $ 


That was easy.
Are they the same?
dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ ls -l carrot.txt caret.txt caret2.txt 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 dan dan 50 Feb 11 07:55 caret2.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 dan dan 50 Feb 11 07:54 caret.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 dan dan 50 Feb 11 07:37 carrot.txt
dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ cat caret2.txt 
To create a file, a caret is better than a stick.

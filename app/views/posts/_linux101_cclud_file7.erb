<code class='bash'>dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ cat sedme.txt 
line 1
line 2
sed was here
sed was here
line 3
line 4
dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ 

Now that I know what the file looks like,
I want to use sed to list the second line in the file:

dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ sed -n '2p' sedme.txt
line 2
dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ 

So yes, it did list the second line.
I hope it did not change the file:

dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ cat sedme.txt 
line 1
line 2
sed was here
sed was here
line 3
line 4
dan@feb /tmp $ 
dan@feb /tmp $ 

Yay! the file is unchanged.

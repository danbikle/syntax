# ~/x611/script/hamlposts2questions.rb

# This script should loop through 
# ~/x611/app/views/posts/
# and look for a question in each HAML file.

# If I find a question,
# I should make note of the HAML file name.
# Then I should make note of the question.
# Then, in /tmp/, I should make a 2nd HAML file with the question in it.
# The question will be a link to the 1st HAML file.
# The name of this 2nd HAML file should be built from the question.

# Next, I should append the question-link to
# ~/x611/app/views/questions/index.haml

# ~/x611/script/hamlposts2tags.rb

# This script should loop through 
# ~/x611/app/views/posts/
# and look for tags in each HAML file.

# If I find a tag,
# I should make note of the HAML file name.
# Then I should make note of the tag.
# Then, in /tmp/, I should make a 2nd HAML file with the tag in it.
# The tag will be a link to the 1st HAML file.
# The name of this 2nd HAML file should be built from the tag.

# Next, if the tag is Rails, I should append the tag-link to
# ~/x611/app/views/tags/rails.haml
